# University Information System

## Description
University Information System is a web application designed to provide information to students and teachers. Teachers and students can log into the system using their personal data and password. Teachers can view the courses they have entered, the number of students in these courses, and the students in these courses. Teachers can also enter exam grades into the system. The system determines whether students have passed or failed the course based on their exam grades. Students can check the courses they have taken and their grades in these courses to see if they have passed or failed.
